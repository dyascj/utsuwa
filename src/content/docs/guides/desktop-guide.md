# Desktop Guide

Utsuwa Desktop is **coming soon**.

A native desktop application for Windows, macOS, and Linux is planned. It will include all features from the web version along with enhanced capabilities that benefit from native platform access.

Follow the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dyascj/utsuwa) for updates on development progress and release announcements.

In the meantime, you can use Utsuwa in your browser — see the [Web Guide](/docs/guides/web-guide) to get started.
