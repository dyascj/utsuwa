# Introduction

## TL;DR

- An open-source VRM avatar companion app — an alternative to Grok Companion
- Load a VRM model, connect any LLM provider, and bring your AI companion to life
- Voice, memory, and a relationship system built in
- Local-first — your data stays on your device
- Desktop app with transparent overlay mode (macOS only, Windows/Linux planned)

## What is Utsuwa?

Most AI companions today are either text-only chat interfaces or locked behind proprietary platforms. You don't own the character and you don't own the data.

Utsuwa takes a different approach. It gives you a 3D avatar that speaks, remembers your conversations, and develops a relationship with you over time. No accounts, no subscriptions. Your data stays on your device.

Connect any LLM provider you want — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, xAI, or a local model through Ollama or LM Studio. Add voice with ElevenLabs or OpenAI TTS. Use Groq or your browser's built-in speech recognition for voice input. Load any VRM model as your companion's body. Everything is modular and swappable.

"Utsuwa" means "vessel" in Japanese — a container for AI to inhabit visually. The app is the vessel; you choose what goes inside.
