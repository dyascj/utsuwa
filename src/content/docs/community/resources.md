- Intuitive drawing-based workflow for hair, face, and clothing
- Export directly to `.vrm` format, ready to load into Utsuwa
- Available on Windows, macOS, and iPad
- Completely free to use

VRoid Studio is the easiest way to go from zero to a personalized avatar. Design your character, export the VRM file, and drop it into Utsuwa.
